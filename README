MongoDB not working with Lift 2.4-M2 and sbt 0.10.0

Specifically when going to edit user in the default application and error is thrown
for trying to open an empty box.  Logging in will also fail, but looking at
the mongo DB database, users are saved

Also tested with 2.4-SNAPSHOT using this in build.sbt

resolvers += {
  val snapshots = new java.net.URL("http://scala-tools.org/repo-snapshots")
  Resolver.url("snapshots", snapshots)
}

to get the latest snapshot, can't seem to get it to build at allwith 2.8.1 and 2.4 Snapshot as per, which may solve the problem
